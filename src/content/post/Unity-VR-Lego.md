### Playing with LEGO in VR using Unity

It has quite the banner year for LEGO with a ton of new collaborations with companies spanning industries from Clothing, Movies, Video Games, Furniture, Sesame Street and now Unity for gaming building.

With the latest release of their new Unity integration, I thought I take a look and while I was at it, add SteamVR support so I can see all of my creations, interact with them, and who know what else, all in VR.

The first place to start was to check out the Unity page that includes the the requisite download of Unity Hub, if you don’t have Unity downloaded already, you’ll need to download the Unity Hub and install 2019.4 in order to open the project.

The actual lego tutorials are a part of the learning section once you install and launch Unity Hub. You’ll be able to open and start playing with the pre-built scenes as well as run through tutorials that will help you familiarize yourself with Unity and the Lego bits.

Once you have a project open you’ll want to open the Asset Store and search for SteamVR in order to download and import it into your project.

The next bits are as easy as adding the SteamVR prefab into the scene. There are plenty of SteamVR tutorials to help out if this is a foreign process, or run if you into any trouble.
