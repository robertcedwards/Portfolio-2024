## Project Overview
To address accessibility challenges for individuals like Alex Franklin, who has limited mobility, I led the development of an affordable, open-source puff-and-sip mouse. This device allows users to navigate computers using breath control, offering a cheaper and customizable alternative to existing assistive technologies.

## Impact
The project resulted in a functional, low-cost solution that can be adapted to individual needs. It opened up access to technology for those with severe mobility impairments, reducing financial burdens and improving quality of life.
