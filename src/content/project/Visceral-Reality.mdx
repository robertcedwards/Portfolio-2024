### Enhancing VR Experiences with Sensory Stimuli  
**Role**: Developer, Experiment Designer  

**Technologies**: Virtual Reality (VR), Sensory Integration, Environmental Sensors  

**Focus Areas**: Immersive Experiences, Sensory Feedback, Experimental VR  

## Project Overview  
Visceral Reality is an experimental virtual reality project that explores the impact of real-world sensory stimuli on immersive digital experiences. The project integrates environmental effects such as temperature changes, scents, and airflow into the VR environment, creating a more tangible and emotionally engaging experience. By combining physical sensations with virtual visuals, Visceral Reality aims to deepen user immersion and heighten emotional responses within digital worlds.

## Key Contributions  
- **Sensory Integration**: Designed and implemented the integration of environmental stimuli into VR experiences, using temperature, scent, and airflow to enhance immersion.
- **Experiment Design**: Conducted experiments to test the emotional and physical effects of sensory feedback on users within virtual environments.
- **Immersive Experience Development**: Created VR environments that respond dynamically to sensory inputs, enhancing the overall emotional impact of the experience.

## Impact  
Visceral Reality bridges the gap between the physical and digital worlds by incorporating real-world stimuli into virtual experiences. This project highlights the potential of sensory feedback to enhance emotional engagement and create more immersive virtual environments.

## Outcome  
The project demonstrated how environmental stimuli can be used to deepen user immersion in virtual environments, opening up new possibilities for VR development. It underscores the importance of multi-sensory experiences in creating more engaging digital content.

## Additional Involvement  
This project sparked ongoing explorations into the integration of sensory feedback in VR, with future work focused on expanding the range of stimuli and refining the user experience.
