### Transform your NFTs into dynamic GIFs  
**Role**: Project Lead, Developer  

**Technologies**: Airstack API, Node.js, Canvas API, Next.js, JavaScript  

**Focus Areas**: Backend Development, API Integration, NFT Metadata Processing, Web Interface Design  

## Project Overview  
The NFT GIF Tool is a creative platform designed to transform static NFTs into dynamic GIFs by leveraging the Airstack API. This tool pulls NFT metadata and ownership details from multiple blockchains, compiling them into animated visual representations. Built with Node.js for backend data processing, and Canvas API with JavaScript for GIF creation, the tool features an interactive interface developed using Next.js.

## Key Contributions  
- **Backend Development**: Built the backend logic using Node.js to handle data retrieval and processing, ensuring seamless API integration with Airstack.
- **API Integration**: Successfully integrated the Airstack API to pull NFT metadata and ownership information across multiple chains.
- **Frontend Development**: Designed and implemented a user-friendly web interface using Next.js, allowing users to interact with the tool.
- **Dynamic GIF Creation**: Leveraged the Canvas API and JavaScript libraries to generate animated GIFs based on NFT characteristics.

## Impact  
The NFT GIF Tool enhances the appeal of NFTs by turning static digital assets into dynamic, shareable GIFs. This approach adds a new layer of interactivity to NFTs, allowing artists, collectors, and enthusiasts to showcase their assets in a more engaging way.

## Outcome  
This project demonstrates the potential of blockchain data integration and the creative possibilities with NFTs. By combining backend development, API integration, and frontend design, the tool pushes the boundaries of how NFTs can be experienced and shared.

## Additional Involvement  
In addition to building this tool, I regularly explore ways to innovate within the NFT space, including experimenting with blockchain-based applications and integrating creative coding techniques to enhance digital asset experiences.
