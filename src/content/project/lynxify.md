# Lynxify

**Role**: Project Lead & Chief Growth Officer (CGO)  
**Technologies**: Hedera Blockchain, Hashport API, Web3  
**Focus Areas**: Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Development, Cross-Chain Swapping, Staking, Liquidity Provision

## Project Overview
Lynxify is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Hedera blockchain, enabling seamless token swaps between Hedera and Layer 2 (L2) networks. By leveraging the Hashport API, Lynxify simplifies the process of moving tokens into Hedera, offering users a user-friendly interface and easy wallet creation. With negligibly low fees and high transaction speed, Lynxify provides a secure and efficient platform for staking and trading ERC-20 assets.

## Key Contributions
- **Cross-Chain Swapping**: Developed the core functionality to facilitate token swaps between Hedera and Ethereum networks using the Hashport API, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Direct Wallet Staking & Trading**: Implemented features allowing users to stake or trade directly from their own wallets, enhancing security and convenience.
- **Single-Side Staking**: Enabled single-side staking, allowing users to earn rewards without needing a pairing token and offering flexible withdrawal options.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Focused on designing and refining the web app interface to provide an intuitive user experience for seamless wallet creation and cross-chain transactions.

## Impact
Lynxify addresses the need for accessible and cost-effective liquidity provision for crypto assets, eliminating the complexity and high fees often associated with other platforms. By allowing users to stake and trade directly from their wallets with minimal fees, Lynxify has positioned itself as a key player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem on the Hedera network.

## Outcome
Lynxify successfully integrates cross-chain swapping, staking, and trading functionalities into a streamlined DEX platform. By leveraging the Hedera blockchainâ€™s low fees and fast transactions, Lynxify provides an efficient solution for users seeking liquidity without the usual fuss and fees, making decentralized finance more accessible and user-friendly.

## Additional Involvement
In addition to leading growth at Lynxify, I contributed to Backdrop Build v5, collaborating with other developers to enhance platform infrastructure and scalability. These insights have directly influenced the development of Lynxify's seamless cross-chain transaction system and user-friendly interface.
