# Two Bit Circus Moonshot
**[Two Bit Circus](https://twobitcircus.com/)**  

### Creating an Interactive Installation for Team One  
**Role**: Creative Technologist  

**Technologies**: RGB LEDs, EEG, Drum Pads, Microcontrollers  

**Focus Areas**: Interactive Installations, Event Design, Education through Technology  

## Project Overview  
The Two Bit Circus Moonshot event, hosted by Team One, challenged our creative technologist group to build an installation under the theme "Science is the new rock and roll." The resulting project, titled "Brain vs. Brawn," featured two 7ft guitars: one controlled by physical strength and another by mental focus using a hacked EEG sensor. This installation aimed to engage participants with science through playful and interactive experiences.

## Key Contributions  
- **Interactive Installation Development**: Built and programmed two large-scale guitars for a carnival-like installation, integrating RGB LEDs and sensors.
- **EEG Integration**: Hacked an EEG device to measure concentration levels, lighting up the guitar based on mental focus.
- **High-Striker Game Design**: Designed a drum pad-based high-striker game to measure physical strength, lighting up LEDs depending on the force of the strike.
- **Engagement**: Created a visually striking and interactive exhibit that encouraged participants to engage with scientific concepts in a fun and engaging way.

## Impact  
The installation successfully attracted attention at the event, helping to demystify science through an engaging, carnival-like atmosphere. It reinforced the concept that learning can be both fun and interactive, drawing participants into an experience that combined technology and education.

## Outcome  
This project demonstrated the ability to combine art, science, and technology into an engaging experience. The installation highlighted skills in large-scale interactive design, sensor integration, and creative event production.

## Additional Involvement  
In addition to this event, I continue to explore the intersection of technology and education, creating installations that make learning both accessible and exciting.
