# Huddle Space

https://github.com/Team-One/huddlebuddy

### Real-Time Sensor Network for Office Spaces  
**Role**: Lead Developer  

**Technologies**: BeagleBone, MQTT, Low-Power Radio Networks, Custom PCB  

**Focus Areas**: IoT, Real-Time Sensor Networks, Office Solutions  

## Project Overview  
Huddle Space is an IoT solution that helps employees locate available meeting rooms in real-time while providing valuable analytics on room usage. The system uses low-power motion sensors connected to BeagleBone gateways, transmitting room occupancy data to a responsive website. This interface displays room availability in an easy-to-read map view, allowing employees to quickly find open spaces and optimize their workday.

## Key Contributions  
- **Sensor Network Development**: Created a custom network of 50 real-time motion sensors paired with BeagleBone gateways.
- **Custom Electronics**: Partnered with Low Power Labs to develop custom PCBs and electronics for the low-power radio network.
- **Data Integration**: Used MQTT brokers to handle real-time data delivery to the web interface, ensuring accurate and timely room availability information.
- **User Interface Design**: Developed a modular SASS-based responsive site to display room status on a map, ensuring an intuitive and accessible user experience.

## Impact  
The project improved office efficiency by reducing the time spent searching for available meeting rooms, while also providing analytics to optimize space management. By using a low-power radio network, the system maintained energy efficiency while delivering real-time data.

## Outcome  
Huddle Space demonstrated how IoT and real-time data integration can enhance workplace efficiency and optimize office resources. The system provided both immediate benefits to employees and long-term value through space utilization analytics.

## Additional Involvement  
Beyond the initial implementation, I continue to refine IoT-based solutions to help businesses optimize their spaces and workflows using smart technology.
