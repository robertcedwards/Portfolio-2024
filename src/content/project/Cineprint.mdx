## Project Overview  
The Lexus CinePrint™ project was an innovative advertising campaign that combined traditional print with digital media. Users could place an iPad behind a magazine page to activate a visual and auditory experience, bringing the Lexus 2013 ES to life with animated visuals and sound. This multi-sensory approach created a tactile and engaging connection with the audience, blending the physical and digital worlds in a new way.

## Key Contributions  
- **CinePrint™ Technology**: Utilized innovative technology to merge print and digital media, creating a unique interactive experience.
- **Video and Print Integration**: Integrated video content with traditional print ads, allowing users to engage with the ad in a multi-sensory way.
- **Engagement Strategy**: Developed a new way to connect with audiences through a tactile, immersive experience that blurred the lines between digital and physical advertising.

## Impact  
The CinePrint™ campaign set a new standard for interactive advertising, combining the best of both print and digital worlds. It demonstrated how traditional media could be revitalized with modern technology, creating a more engaging and memorable experience for viewers.

## Outcome  
This project showcased the potential of combining print and digital technologies, enhancing brand engagement and offering a novel experience that captivated audiences. The success of this campaign led to further exploration of interactive and immersive advertising strategies.

## Additional Involvement  
Following this project, I continued to explore how digital and physical media could be integrated to create unique and engaging advertising experiences.
